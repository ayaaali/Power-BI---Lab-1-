# Bahrain Imports Dashboard (2020–2023)

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes Bahrain’s import activities between **2020 and 2023**.  
The dashboard transforms raw trade data into meaningful insights, allowing policymakers, businesses, and researchers to understand trends, top commodities, and key trading partners.

## Problem Statement
Bahrain imports thousands of commodities from hundreds of countries every year.  
While the data is available, it is large, complex, and not easy to interpret in raw format.  
This makes it difficult to answer important questions like:
- Which countries supply the most imports to Bahrain?
- What are the top commodities and categories?
- How have import values changed over time?

---

## Objectives
The aim of this project is to:
- Visualize **total import values, weights, and quantities** clearly.  
- Identify **top commodities, categories, and subcategories** driving imports.  
- Highlight **key trading partners** and their contribution to Bahrain’s economy.  
- Show **trends over time (2020–2023)** to detect growth or decline in imports.

## Dashboard Features
- **Key KPIs:** Total import value, total quantity, total commodities, number of countries.  
- **Time Trend:** Import value trend from 2020 to 2023.  
- **By Category:** Breakdown of import value by major categories (machinery, minerals, chemicals, etc.).  
- **By Subcategory:** Deep dive into specific sectors (e.g., nuclear reactors, ores, chemicals).  
- **By Commodity:** Top individual commodities (e.g., iron ores, petroleum oils, gold).  
- **By Country:** Top import partners like China, Brazil, UAE, Australia, and Saudi Arabia.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – for dashboard creation and data visualization.  
- **Power Query** – for data cleaning and transformation.  
- **Excel / CSV** – as the data source.  

---

## Key Insights
- Imports peaked in **2022** at 5.84 billion BD before a slight dip in 2023.  
- **Machinery and Electrical equipment** is the largest import category.
